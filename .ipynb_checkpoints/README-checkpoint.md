# pandas-challenge-1
Challenge 4 - Alexis Wukich

For this challenge I referenced the assignment, and the provided starter code. I also referenced the Pandas DataFrame reference tool that has been provided throughout class, which can be found at https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html.

I also heavily relied on my notes and the in-class demonstrations and activies.
